### Classification (Project 1.1)  We use the AutoTokenizer to tokenize the text data and prepare it for input to the sequence classification model. ## Relationship Analysis (Project 1.2)  In addition to classification, this project processes subtitles from the "Demon Slayer" series to extract relationships between characters using NLP techniques.
