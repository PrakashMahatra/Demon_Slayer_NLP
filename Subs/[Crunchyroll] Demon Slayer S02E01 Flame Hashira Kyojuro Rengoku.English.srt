DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
MUGEN TRAIN ARC

00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,900
EPISODE 1:
FLAME HASHIRA
KYOJURO RENGOKU

3
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,570
MISSING PERSON

4
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,080
NOODLES

5
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,340
Delicious!

6
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,180
Delicious!

7
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,180
Delicious!

8
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,730
Flame Hashira, forgive me
for interrupting your meal.

9
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,190
Okay! Take a seat here.

10
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,650
Mister, bring this young man
the same thing I'm having!

11
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,110
Are you sure it's okay?

12
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,950
Of course it's okay!
I'll have another bowl myself!

13
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,870
You sure eat with gusto, don't you?

14
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,870
Just sit tight.

15
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,460
Flame Hashira,
your work last night was stellar.

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,710
No.

17
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,470
It was after the demon fled, after all.

18
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,720
How's the injured woman doing?

19
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,390
According to the doctor,
her wounds won't leave her with any scars.

20
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,390
I see. Good thing she got treated early.

21
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,270
Yes. It's thanks to your heroics.

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,450
Thank you for the meal!

23
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,830
What's this?

24
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,000
That's my treat.

25
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,420
Appreciate it!

26
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,750
Hey! Delicious!

27
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,340
Mister, I bet you'd really thrive
if you set up shop in Ueno!

28
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,470
What do you know about it?

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,760
Mister, how's business these days?

30
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,020
How's it look to you?

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,520
Sorry.

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,520
THE SLASHER APPEARS AGAIN
TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S BODY
WAS FOUND IN TRAIN
BRUTALLY MURDERED

33
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,810
Thanks to all the talk about
that Slasher being at large around here,

34
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,520
people just stopped coming out at night.

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,780
POSSIBILITY OF USING TRAINS
FOR TRANSPORTATION

36
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,150
I even had to let my workers go.

37
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,780
They say that a conductor got killed
the other day.

38
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,160
On top of that, do you know that
the Mugen Train is out of service now?

39
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,540
Rumor has it...

40
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,550
that around 40 of its passengers
just disappeared without a trace.

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,090
Oh... It sounds ominous.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,050
Flame Hashira,
getting back to why I'm here...

43
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,180
We've located the Mugen Train.

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,180
MUGEN

45
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,180
We've received word that it was secretly
transported to a certain train shed.

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,560
Is that right?

47
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,810
Delicious!

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,320
Will we be heading to the Mugen Train?

49
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,400
Right.

50
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,820
But first...

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,620
let's inspect the station
where the conductor's body was found.

52
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,710
Fuku, enough of that sighing.
Go on and eat your bean paste bun.

53
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,170
Yeah.

54
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,930
Not many customers today again, right?

55
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,390
I know that I say this every day,
but it's dangerous to be out after dark.

56
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,060
Tomorrow, you can start
helping out in the afternoon.

57
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,690
Since the demons come out at night.

58
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,230
All clear!

59
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,740
I took a look around the area,
but there was nothing amiss.

60
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,700
Right!

61
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,160
There aren't any demons!

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,990
You're bringing up demons again?

63
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,910
Just stop, will you?
I have to sell as many bento as I can!

64
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,250
It's hard enough
with my mother being pregnant,

65
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,920
and I heard that
my father's shop isn't doing well.

66
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,920
HOW TO COOK WESTERN FOOD

67
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,090
You can leave that kind
of worrying to us adults.

68
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,180
I'll take care of things in the early mornings
and nighttime by myself, okay?

69
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,770
And what are we going to do
if you get attacked by the Slasher, too?

70
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,650
BEEF NABE BENTO

71
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,650
REGULAR BENTO

72
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,440
I would be more than happy
to sacrifice my life for yours.

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,650
Grandma!

74
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,650
Well, good evening!

75
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,150
The moon is exquisite tonight, is it not?

76
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,740
I'm searching for a demon.

77
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,490
You haven't seen one, have you?

78
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,370
What? Just like that?

79
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,160
Lord Kyojuro!
You're being far too blunt!

80
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,750
Ma'am, is there something
you can tell me?

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,300
D-Demon? What kind of talk is that?
Wh-What's wrong with you?

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,970
Stay away from us!

83
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,390
Look out!

84
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,010
If you keep shaking like that,

85
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,350
you'll end up dropping
your precious bean paste bun!

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,940
Stay away from me!

87
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,610
Delicious!

88
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,280
I don't believe in demons!

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,620
There's no way there could be any,
and you know it!

90
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,830
Fuku, that's enough.

91
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,080
I don't believe this man is a bad person.

92
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,090
I'm sorry. I feel like I'm always on edge
these days because of the Slasher incidents.

93
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,180
If what I was just told is correct,

94
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,140
you two start working while it's still dark out
and come to sell us those bento.

95
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,600
I couldn't be more thankful.

96
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,610
No one should ever hurt people like you.

97
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,860
But you can rest easy now!
I'll take care of the Slasher!

98
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,950
Who in the world are you?

99
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,610
All right, then!

100
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,240
Excuse me!

101
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,580
Um... If you don't mind,
could you maybe buy some bento?

102
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,130
That's a good idea!

103
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay!

104
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,880
I'll buy them all!

105
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,590
Excuse me, Flame Hashira...

106
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,310
That'll make a splendid gift
for the other Corps members!

107
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,600
I'll be going on alone now.
Thanks for your hard work.

108
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,850
Goodbye.

109
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,190
What was that all about?

110
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,070
I'm glad he bought all those bento, but...

111
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,910
Let's hurry home now, Fuku.

112
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,870
I'm getting a really bad feeling.

113
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,750
I can feel a chill going down my spine.

114
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,120
Grandma?

115
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,070
Who...

116
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,490
Who are you?

117
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,160
I'm a bento vendor as you can see!

118
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,660
I am in no way suspicious!

119
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,250
But this train is heading to the shed now.

120
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,590
Right! I'm aware of that.

121
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,010
I heard that's where
I can find the Mugen Train.

122
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,630
That's the one I have business with.

123
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,890
The Mugen Train?

124
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,300
If that's the one you're looking for,
it's no longer in the shed.

125
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,100
Is that right?

126
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,020
It was transported to a well-equipped
maintenance facility this morning.

127
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,900
That one over there.

128
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
Ah.

129
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,070
All right, then this is
where I'm getting off!

130
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,030
What?

131
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,860
What do you mean, "get off"?

132
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,620
Hey!

133
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,020
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
MUGEN TRAIN ARC

134
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,020
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
MUGEN TRAIN ARC

135
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,240
The Mugen Train...

136
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,950
I see.

137
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Though faint, the trace of a demon remains.

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
MUGEN

139
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,540
Hey you!

140
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,540
This place is off-limits!

141
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,790
Hey!

142
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,380
I was sent here by the Railway Bureau
to deliver these bento.

143
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,380
Oh?

144
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,640
Hey! He says he brought us bento!

145
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,190
Hey, take one to Tatsu.
He's resting in the office.

146
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,560
Yes, sir.

147
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,190
Why was the Mugen Train brought here?

148
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,740
Right, when there's no way
it's a problem with the body.

149
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,490
Word on the street
is that it's a man-eating train.

150
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,200
You don't know how bitter that makes us.

151
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,250
So now that it's being put
back into service,

152
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,380
we want to do all we can to get her back into shape
and send her back out into the world.

153
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,380
Back into service?

154
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,470
Yeah, tomorrow night.
That's why we're all here—

155
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,720
Demon!

156
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,560
There's a demon here!

157
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,280
Oh!

158
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,240
Tatsu!

159
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,490
All of you, step back!

160
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,200
Chief!

161
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
You bastard...

162
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,830
Let the boy go!

163
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,540
A Demon Slayer? How arrogant.

164
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,750
Ugh! What's this stench?

165
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,760
Ever since I became a demon,
I can't stand human food. It's so disgusting.

166
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,010
That bento was made with love
by people I know.

167
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,600
I can't just ignore that.

168
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,560
If it's revolting, it's revolting.

169
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,060
Hey boy, your blood smells
like it might be revolting, too.

170
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,690
I'll just devour the humans that seem tasty,
but the ones that taste bad...

171
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,160
I like to show myself a good time
by tormenting them all night!

172
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,030
So, that's what this is about, Slasher?

173
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,660
I find you offensive.

174
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,830
If you don't like me, then...

175
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,540
let's see you slash me!

176
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,000
Wha...

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,790
What's going on?

178
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,380
No one's ever been able to stop me.

179
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,010
I'm the fastest...

180
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,760
of them all!

181
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,680
Hey, sorry about that.

182
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,890
You can't bring yourself to slash me
with this kid in my arms.

183
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,730
Should I be considerate
and just kill him off?

184
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,150
H-Help...

185
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,520
Help me!

186
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,360
Don't worry!

187
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,780
I'm going to save you, no matter what!

188
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,610
Not on your life. Just yesterday...

189
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,290
I slashed this other woman
until I was sick of doing it.

190
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,750
I see. Now I know how fast you are.

191
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,750
But I wouldn't get cocky if I were you.

192
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,630
Last night, we thought
you'd fled because we showed up,

193
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,470
but apparently, you never even detected us.

194
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,640
It's true that you're quick to escape at least!

195
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,020
What?

196
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,400
We were able to treat your victim
from last night right away.

197
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,490
She'll recover without even a single scar.

198
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:51,290
Even if she does survive, she's doomed
to be consumed by fear for the rest of her life.

199
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,000
I won't let that happen!

200
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,540
We're going to treat
the wounds of her soul,

201
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,790
no matter how hard it may be to heal them,
for as long as it takes!

202
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,220
I'll show that self-righteous
face of yours a thing or two.

203
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,800
I'm going to go kill that woman again!

204
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,140
We're keeping her hidden!

205
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,680
You'll never find her!

206
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,520
All right, then those bento vendors...

207
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,150
They have nothing to do with me!

208
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,990
But you know them, right?

209
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,780
Those are station bento, right?
I can find out where they're from.

210
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,240
Don't move!

211
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,240
You do offend me, you know.

212
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,250
Well, I'm enjoying this!

213
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,500
If you want to save them,
then get to the station before me.

214
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,670
Before that happens...

215
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,170
I'll have to kill this one!

216
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,440
I'll be going on ahead.

217
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,950
Please...

218
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,330
Please save him!

219
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,040
It'll be okay. Just leave it to me.

220
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,960
Also, my friends will be coming soon.

221
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,460
This way! This way! This way!

222
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,050
Lord Rengoku!

223
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,380
Where's the medical squad?

224
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,760
They're on their way.

225
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,800
I've given him first aid.
I'm leaving the rest to you.

226
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,320
Total Concentration Breathing.

227
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,880
Really, you don't listen, do you?

228
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,840
If I say I'm going to help,
then I'm going to help!

229
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,550
Good morning!

230
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,310
Hey! You're as early as ever!

231
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,940
I can smell them!

232
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,200
All right!

233
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,290
Station Master?

234
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,790
It smells. It smells!

235
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,540
It's you, isn't it?

236
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,050
The one who's got the stink
of those bento clinging to her!

237
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,300
Don't take this personally.

238
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,300
It's all that Demon Slayer's fault!

239
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,190
Make a run for it, Fuku!

240
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,190
What's the big idea, you hag?

241
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,890
Y-You're...

242
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,890
You're not hurt, are you?

243
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,640
Grandma!

244
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,900
Damn!

245
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,410
Hey, old hag...

246
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,240
You're going to wish you hadn't...

247
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,000
How the hell...

248
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,750
did you catch up to me?

249
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,680
I thought I told you not to get cocky.

250
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,350
Why don't we see who's faster?

251
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,730
Whether I can slash
this old hag's throat first

252
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,190
or you can claim my head first!

253
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,570
No need to put it to the test.

254
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,200
You're...

255
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,120
slow!

256
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,160
Flame Breathing...

257
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,450
First Form...

258
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,710
Unknowing Fire!

259
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,880
You...

260
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,920
saved us, didn't you?

261
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,010
Twice.

262
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,260
Grandma...

263
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,140
I'll never forget that face, that haori.

264
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,180
Fuku's mother...

265
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
and I...

266
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,070
20 years ago, you saved our lives.

267
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,820
Grandma, what are you talking about?

268
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,080
That must've been my father.

269
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,790
I'm following in my father's footsteps,
slaying demons.

270
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,590
I'm honored to have protected you
just as my father did.

271
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,100
I still can't believe it!

272
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,350
I'm sorry for saying that
there couldn't be any demons, Grandma.

273
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,570
No! That's how it should be!

274
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,280
Not knowing about demons,
never running into one...

275
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,360
There's no better way to live out your life!

276
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,620
Flame Hashira! Are you all right?

277
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,910
I only just took care of it now.

278
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,460
Thank you for a job well done!

279
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,370
Right!

280
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,840
So, what about the Mugen Train?

281
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,300
The maintenance work
will be done tonight,

282
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,880
and it's going back into service tomorrow.

283
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,140
I'm glad to hear that!
So all's well that ends well, right?

284
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,850
It's a little too soon to be saying that.

285
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,520
A demon who's devoured more than 40 people
is surely on a different level than this one.

286
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,270
Then, the Slasher was only here
to serve as a distraction?

287
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,570
That might very well be true.

288
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,570
Either way, there's a different demon
on the Mugen Train.

289
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,700
A demon who's far more powerful
and mysterious is lurking somewhere.

290
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,660
Tomorrow, to the Mugen Train, then.

291
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,920
Needless to say, I'll be boarding it!

292
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,210
Actually, it's today now!

293
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,590
Hey, Pops, did you hear?

294
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,010
Huh?

295
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,680
They say that the Mugen Train
is back in service.

296
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,180
MUGEN TRAIN
TO RESUME OPERATION

297
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,180
Oh?

298
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,190
I just hope nothing odd happens again.

299
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,990
Excuse me!

300
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,290
Hey there, bento vendor!

301
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,750
I don't know what to say
to thank you for this morning.

302
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,880
Please take these.

303
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,840
This is all that we have to give you.

304
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,670
Ah! The thing is,
I missed out on having one last night!

305
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,090
Nothing could make me happier!

306
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,850
But I will pay for it.

307
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,100
No, it's the thought
that counts!

308
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,020
Is that right?
Then let me accept this one

309
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,520
and buy all the rest that you have there!

310
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,230
Whaaaaat?

311
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,990
Please be careful.

312
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,700
Please stop by again
if you're in the area!

313
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,780
I promise to tell my father about you two.

314
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,700
I'm sure he'll be thrilled.

315
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,290
Now then, take care!
Let's meet again one day!

316
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,230
Wha...

317
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,110
Wh-What...

318
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,110
What the hell is this creature?

319
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,320
Here's your first-class bento!
That will be 36 sen, please!

320
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,950
Would you like some tea
or sake with that?

321
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,540
Comin' through!

322
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Stop it! You're embarrassing us!

323
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,210
What's going on?

324
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,990
Now then, let me partake of this
with gratitude!

325
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,460
Delicious!

326
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,520
So, we were able
to board the Mugen Train!

327
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,440
Tanjiro, isn't there something
you want to ask the Flame Hashira?

328
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,820
I hope we get to meet him!

329
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,570
Yeah!

330
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,360
Hashira, huh? Fight me!

331
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,580
Stop that yammering!
Just shut up!

332
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,290
What did you say?

333
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,750
You have a problem with that?

334
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,790
Okay, we hear you, Inosuke!
Calm down now!

335
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,210
You idiot boar!

336
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,750
Anyway, I wonder what kind of person
the Flame Hashira is.

337
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,920
Well—

338
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,220
It's the Kasugai Crow!

339
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,060
It seems like the Kasugai Crow
has looked into Rengoku for us.

340
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,640
What? Really?

341
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,230
He says he found out
how the other Hashira feel about Rengoku.

342
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,520
That I have to hear!

343
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,530
Hashira! All of you, fight me!

344
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,740
All right. Tanjiro, let's hear it.

345
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,320
Okay. Then, let me start
with Lady Shinobu.

346
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:47,340
HOW THE INSECT HASHIRA
SHINOBU KOCHO
SEES RENGOKU

347
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,540
I'd say he's a good person.

348
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,500
Though there are times
when we're not on the same wavelength.

349
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,040
Lady Shinobu!
You remind me of that good smell!

350
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,460
How about the other Hashira?

351
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,340
Okay, let's hear them all in one go!

352
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:52,590
ACCORDING TO TENGEN UZUI

353
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,550
Flamboyant!
