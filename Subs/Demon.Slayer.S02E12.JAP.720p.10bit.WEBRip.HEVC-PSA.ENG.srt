1
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,780
Hinatsuru!

2
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,000
EPISODE 5:
THINGS ARE GONNA GET REAL FLASHY!!

3
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,180
Forgive me, Lord Tengen.

4
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,850
Never mind. Stop talking.

5
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,140
I realized that Warabihime Oiran
was a demon,

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,190
but she became suspicious of me, as well.

7
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,190
So I drank some poison
and tried to slip out of the House.

8
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:32,570
But it seems this Belt that I was given by
Warabihime Oiran was for spying on and killing me.

9
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,950
So I was unable to contact you.

10
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,460
Lord Tengen, do not trouble yourself
with me. Please go now.

11
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,460
You heard that sound
just now, did you not?

12
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,970
The demon is on a rampage.

13
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,100
You're sure you're going to be all right?

14
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,470
Yes.

15
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,350
I am sorry I couldn't be of use to you.

16
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,370
There's no need for you
to do anything more.

17
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,780
Once the antidote starts working,
leave Yoshiwara.

18
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,860
You hear me?

19
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,120
Yes.

20
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,130
The battle has already begun.

21
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,620
Where is it?

22
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,630
Search for its presence!

23
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,930
It's here. Underground!

24
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,350
I can hear the sound of someone battling.

25
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,150
I can hear it well thanks
to the reverberations.

26
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,860
There's something here!

27
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,120
Sound Breathing...

28
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,950
First Form...

29
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,860
Roar!

30
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,289
UPPER SIX

31
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,040
What an infernal racket,
you piece of trash!

32
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,920
What is that sound?
What are you doing?

33
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,210
Where?

34
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,510
From the Ogimoto House?

35
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,300
And also Hinatsuru...

36
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,009
How many of you are here?

37
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,010
Four?

38
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm not telling you!

39
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,350
If you tell me the truth,
I'd be willing to spare your life.

40
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,110
We clashed for maybe an instant,
but look at your sword!

41
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,950
It's already nicked.

42
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,209
Some hack of a swordsmith
must've forged that blade, am I right?

43
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,329
You're wrong!

44
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,330
The person who forged
this sword is amazing!

45
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,620
He's a brilliant swordsmith!

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,290
Then how did it get nicked, moron?

47
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,800
It's starting to get noisy
all over the place.

48
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,800
It's annoying me,
so this time, I'm going to kill you.

49
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,940
The blade gets nicked
when its wielder is subpar.

50
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,970
It's my fault!

51
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,020
I...

52
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,560
When all is said and done, I...

53
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,650
can't handle...

54
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,080
the Water Breathing technique!

55
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,160
My body's not suited for Water Breathing!

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,920
I can't become like Urokodaki or Tomioka
with the Water Breathing technique!

57
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,579
In my case...

58
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,380
I just can't help striking harder
with the Hinokami Kagura.

59
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
It's just compatible with my body!

60
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,380
But...

61
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,810
Would it kill you
to hold back a little, idiot?

62
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,639
That would be no way to train!

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,270
Hinokami Kagura!

64
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,180
Huh?

65
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,320
Flame Dance!

66
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,660
Clear Blue...

67
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,160
Tanjiro!

68
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,489
Tanjiro! Are you okay?

69
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,790
What? Are you hungry?

70
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,119
- Dummy!
- Huh?

71
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,960
- Boar!
- Huh?

72
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,960
Because of its sheer force...

73
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,580
I couldn't unleash multiple strikes.

74
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,470
Hang in there! I'll go fetch Shinobu!

75
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,589
It's different now!

76
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,340
I should be able to do it!

77
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,790
No!

78
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm doing it!

79
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,550
That's what I've been training for!

80
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,180
Don't go down in defeat! Ablaze!

81
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,600
Ablaze! Ablaze!

82
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,310
Set your heart ablaze!

83
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,480
Hinokami Kagura...

84
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,320
Raging Sun!

85
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,240
His swordsmanship style just changed!

86
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,990
It's sharper than before.

87
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,700
What the hell is this sound?

88
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,420
Such an unpleasant sound!
The sound of breathing?

89
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,210
Flame Dance!

90
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,920
Flame Dance is a two-hit strike!
Even if she dodges it, there's one more!

91
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,090
That was nothing to write home about.

92
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,100
In the end, this is all it amounts to!

93
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,060
Where is he?

94
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,730
Hinokami Kagura...

95
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,390
Fake Rainbow...

96
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,440
An opening! The Opening Thread!

97
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,860
I can do this!

98
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,580
Hinokami Kagura...

99
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,900
Fire Wheel!

100
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,670
So slow. You're making me yawn.

101
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,420
Go on the defensive!

102
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,730
Defensive!

103
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,100
This is the fallout
from using the Hinokami Kagura!

104
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,240
All that built-up fatigue
is making my muscles tighten up!

105
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,100
Oh, so you're still alive?

106
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,940
Calm down.

107
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,400
Get your breathing under control!

108
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,450
Recover!

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,900
Hurry!

110
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,450
Recovery Breathing!

111
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,960
This Belt is like a powerful blade!

112
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,960
Even if I glimpse an Opening Thread,
it vanishes just like that!

113
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,840
My attacks are too slow!

114
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,890
Raise your body temperature!

115
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,640
Get your body temperature up!

116
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,180
I'm going to inform
Lady Shinobu, all right?

117
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,850
That your temperature
still hasn't gone down!

118
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,110
Kiyo, please! I'm begging you!

119
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,370
Keep it between us! I'm fine, okay?

120
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,610
But...

121
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,399
I'm feeling fine, see?

122
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,740
I'm fine! Never felt better!

123
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,410
Just look at this thermometer!

124
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,620
100.4 degrees!

125
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,620
Just like yesterday
and the day before that, remember?

126
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,380
It's been like that for days!

127
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,890
Uh...

128
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,760
If you have a fever that won't go down,
that means something's wrong!

129
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,850
I have no idea what I should do about it!

130
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,230
Only Lady Shinobu would know!

131
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,020
The thing is...

132
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,230
when I have a fever,
I'm at the top of my game!

133
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,319
I can unleash
multiple Hinokami Kagura strikes!

134
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,610
I might become even stronger!

135
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,630
Can't you wait just a little longer
before telling Lady Shinobu?

136
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,199
Just a little longer!

137
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,750
Just a little bit!

138
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,130
Very well.

139
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,460
But just a little longer, okay?

140
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,180
I can feel my temperature...

141
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,350
my body heat rising!

142
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,930
I'm able to fight...

143
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,180
an Upper Rank Demon!

144
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,060
You're a pesky one.
More than I thought you'd be.

145
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,770
This is entertaining.

146
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,689
I can do it!

147
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,190
Hinokami Kagura's effective!

148
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,110
No! It's not enough for it be effective!

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,279
I have to win!

150
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,160
Using every ounce of my power!

151
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,040
I'm gonna win, no matter what!

152
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,540
To protect them.

153
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,340
To protect lives!

154
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,960
Never again.

155
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,130
I won't let them be robbed for no reason.

156
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,880
Never again!

157
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,140
I won't let anyone...

158
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,560
suffer the same grief that we did!

159
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,030
You ugly people are still ugly,
even when you try so hard!

160
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,989
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

161
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,999
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,685
OGIMOTO HOUSE

163
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:59,370
SOMEWHAT EARLIER

164
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,459
What's going on?

165
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,879
It's a monster! A monster!

166
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,129
Hey, go get ready for work!

167
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,430
There's a monster boar that's
demolishing the ceilings and the floors!

168
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,340
Huh?

169
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,939
How is that even possible?

170
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,140
Then come with me!

171
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,610
I'm totally feeling the demon's presence!

172
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,160
Is it here?

173
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,660
Found it!

174
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,459
The hole leading to the demon's lair!

175
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,539
Get ready to die!

176
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,440
Ugh!

177
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,090
So I can only get my head inside, huh?

178
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,970
Nice try! That won't work
on Lord Inosuke!

179
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,480
I'm a man who can dislocate all his joints!

180
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,650
In other words, as long as my head fits,
there's nowhere that I can't go!

181
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:15,120
Comin' through! No one can stop me!

182
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Freakin' long! This is no game trail!

183
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,119
A demon!

184
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,750
There's a demon here!

185
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,630
What the heck is this?

186
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,370
Huh? A cloth with a human pattern?

187
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,990
What is this?

188
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,860
No, this feels like...

189
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,660
those are living humans.

190
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,910
So it traps humans
inside a woman's belly band, huh?

191
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,250
Damn. Then it takes them out
whenever it wants, and devours them?

192
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,010
Pretty savage, if you ask me.

193
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,300
What's he doing here?

194
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,940
No, what are you doing?

195
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,440
Barging in on someone else's food locker...

196
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,309
So dirty!

197
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,189
How dirty you are!

198
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,440
Dirty!

199
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,780
Smelly! You damn stinkbug!

200
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,780
What did you say, you worm? So gross!

201
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,700
Why, you damn stinkbug!

202
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,080
Wriggle, wriggle, wriggle, wriggle!

203
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,870
You're really grossing me out, Worm Belt!

204
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,170
Look how sluggish you are!

205
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,710
You got greedy
and swallowed up too many humans!

206
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,590
An attack by an overweight worm...

207
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,350
will never land on Lord Inosuke!

208
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,970
Grow a spine...

209
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,040
and don't come back until you're ready!

210
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,360
Damn! He managed to slice me
without touching the humans!

211
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,530
After I went to the trouble
of storing all that fresh food!

212
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,360
His intuition is razor-sharp!

213
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,949
Especially his ability to detect
murderous intent is extraordinary!

214
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,530
So sensitive...

215
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,380
he can perceive attacks
from any direction and dodge them!

216
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,880
I never expected a Demon Slayer
to infiltrate the food locker.

217
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,500
What should I do?

218
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,660
Capture him alive.

219
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:35,810
UPPER SIX

220
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,099
He's the one who got in my way
when I captured Makio.

221
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,760
He was beautiful.

222
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,150
Except for the ten most beautiful,
you can kill the humans you've stored.

223
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,980
Though it might prove harder to capture
them alive than to merely kill them...

224
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:00,240
Devour some of the ones there
and strengthen your body.

225
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,040
I can't slash it!
Because it's bending like that?

226
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,840
Beast Breathing, Sixth Fang...

227
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,090
Palisade Bite!

228
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,350
It won't do any good to slash me.
I'm not the main body.

229
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,230
Never mind that. You're leaving the humans
you saved in the lurch. Is that what you want?

230
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,320
Whatever you do to me,
I can get it back in a flash!

231
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,829
Oh, crap! I have to fight it
while protecting those humans!

232
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,730
Dammit!

233
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,790
I can't keep up!

234
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,620
You damn Worm Belt!

235
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,670
You came up with a great name!
"Worm Belt"!

236
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,760
It really is gross!

237
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,759
You're absolutely right!

238
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,470
I'm so going to tell Lord Tengen on you!

239
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,800
We're going to give you a hand...

240
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,350
so fight the good fight, Boar Head!

241
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,060
Who the heck are you?

242
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,349
We're Uzui's wives!

243
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,110
I'm not much of a fighter!

244
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,320
So please don't get your hopes up!

245
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,160
Suma! Don't be such a wimp!

246
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,629
But... But... Makio, you know
I'm a good-for-nothing!

247
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,409
I mean, I got captured right away!
It's too much to ask of me!

248
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,750
Protecting everyone who got caught!
I'm the most liable to die first!

249
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,519
That's right! How astute you are!

250
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,260
Now then, which one
of you should I eat first?

251
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,590
Damn that thing!
It's not the main body?

252
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,970
If that's true, I'm screwed!
This battle's never gonna end!

253
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,850
Thunder Breathing...

254
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,980
First Form...

255
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,190
Thunderclap and Flash.

256
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,610
Sixfold.

257
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,829
Maybe you should stay asleep
the whole time.

258
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,735
THE ONES WHO DELIVERED
ZENITSU'S SWORD

259
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:18,960
- Muscle!
- Muscle!

260
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,719
Is that kid a Demon Slayer, too?

261
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,420
Why is he dressed like an idiot?

262
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,060
I have no idea!

263
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:31,570
Hey! The next one's coming! Move!

264
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,929
Who is that boy?

265
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,759
Such blistering speed!

266
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,560
No, forget that.

267
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,310
Didn't I just hear two sounds?

268
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,270
A noise like overlapping thunderbolts,
creating two sounds.

269
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,520
One was that boy.

270
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,040
The other one...

271
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,570
came from above?

272
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,790
The wind?

273
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,410
Did an air hole open up?

274
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,840
What can you do from aboveground
to create a hole all the way down here?

275
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,670
What the hell?

276
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,380
He's here.

277
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Someone just came inside.

278
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,930
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

279
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,200
This presence!

280
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,910
A Hashira!

281
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,710
Lord Tengen...

282
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,209
DESTROY

283
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,300
Makio...

284
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,970
Suma...

285
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,170
Sorry I took so long.

286
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,480
It's a relief to see you looking good!

287
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,850
He wasn't like this before.

288
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,649
The thought of dying didn't bother me.

289
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,190
Since that was how I was trained.

290
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,870
Because I was a shinobi.

291
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,240
Especially since a kunoichi could never hope
to match a male shinobi in terms of strength.

292
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,250
Staking my life was something
I only needed minimal effort to do.

293
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,590
I want you three
to only think about your own lives.

294
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,269
Above all else, your top priority
is to come back to me.

295
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,760
Life over accomplishing your mission!

296
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,600
What I'm saying is at odds with this occupation,
but it doesn't matter. I'm allowing it!

297
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,980
The order that lives should go in
is flashy and clear-cut in my mind.

298
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,900
First, you three.

299
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,909
Second, law-abiding citizens.

300
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,320
And finally, me.

301
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,710
As a Demon Slayer, it goes without saying that I'll also
protect the public leading their nonchalant, drab lives...

302
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,040
but to be blunt in my flashy way,
you three are more important to me.

303
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,960
So don't die on me.

304
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,220
Is it really okay to go around saying that?

305
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:16,470
If you put your own life first, you can't
get much serious work done. Is that okay?

306
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,480
I think it's okay.

307
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,480
If Lord Tengen says he's fine with it.

308
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,070
Not wanting to die
or wanting to go on living...

309
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,490
I'm sure it's not wrong
to feel that way, either.

310
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,450
As long as you don't despise yourself,
it should be fine.

311
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,990
I'm sure.

312
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,790
You're right.

313
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,140
I see that you've been doing
some flashy work.

314
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,150
You're my wives, all right!

315
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,990
All right!

316
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,040
Starting now,
things are going to get real flashy!

317
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,760
NIN-NIN

318
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,010
Nin-nin!

319
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,479
The Sound Hashira
can't possibly have three wives!

320
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,689
Well, why don't you try
for that, too, Zenitsu?

321
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,730
What? Really?

322
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,480
Okay, then, there's Yoshiko, Sanae,
and then there's...

323
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,109
I have to let Nezuko know.

324
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,610
Tanjiro!

325
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,400
Now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret!

326
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,239
Uzui's family practices polygamy,
and I hear that when you turn 15,

327
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,580
