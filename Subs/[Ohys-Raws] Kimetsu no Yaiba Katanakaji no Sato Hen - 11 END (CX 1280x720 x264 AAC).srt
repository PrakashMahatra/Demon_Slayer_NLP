1
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,900
Don't let it shake you off!
Hang tight!

2
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,310
Hang tight!

3
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,780
DESTROY

4
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,450
It's going to work!

5
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,490
I can do this!

6
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,410
Hinokami Kagura...

7
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,750
Flame Dance!

8
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,170
I still haven't landed a blow
on the demon!

9
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,960
This isn't going to end
until I cut off the main body's head!

10
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,890
It's gone!

11
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,340
It ran off again!

12
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,470
Where'd it go?

13
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,060
You bastard!

14
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,400
Don't run away!

15
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,070
Don't run away from your responsibilities!

16
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,450
You demons who kill and devour humans...

17
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,040
Come on, Nezuko, Genya!

18
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,630
Why are you running away?

19
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,970
Isn't this just what
you've been doing to humans?

20
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,900
Why are you all...

21
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,450
so self-serving?

22
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,870
Behold, "Death Throes of the Smiths"!

23
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,750
Just twist the sword like so, and...

24
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,830
UPPER FIVE

25
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,980
Just now, you tried to slash a small, weak
being who could fit in the palm of your hand.

26
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,980
HATRED

27
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,480
UPPER FOUR

28
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,480
Utterly atrocious...

29
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,150
And yet...

30
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,320
we humans are...

31
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,080
always powerless!

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,250
You're getting in the way, so go hide.

33
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,090
You piece of crap!

34
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,800
Enough is enough...

35
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,890
you stupid moron!

36
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,780
But we're never going to...

37
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,490
give up!

38
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,410
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

39
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,950
FINAL EPISODE: A CONNECTED
BOND: DAYBREAK AND FIRST LIGHT

40
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,400
He runs so fast!

41
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,280
What's his deal?

42
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,030
Dammit!

43
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,120
We'll never catch up!

44
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Did he really have
that much strength left in reserve?

45
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,080
We'll be reaching our limit soon.

46
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,290
If this goes on, he's going to get away!

47
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
It's almost daybreak!

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,260
Ms. Kanroji's reeling off
one powerful attack after another!

49
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,470
It won't be long
before she loses stamina!

50
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,680
And when day breaks,
the demons will escape!

51
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,680
We've got to hurry!

52
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,690
Still...

53
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,190
it's so fast!

54
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Dammit!

55
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,690
He's planning
to keep running forever!

56
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,440
Before day breaks!

57
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,030
Until Ms. Kanroji breaks down!

58
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,990
We're not gonna let you do that!

59
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,620
We're not...

60
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,790
gonna let you win!

61
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,420
It's no use!

62
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't plant my feet!

63
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,170
If only I hadn't injured my left leg!

64
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,010
No good! I can't let this happen!

65
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,050
I have to figure this out!

66
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,140
Tanjiro?

67
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,520
Thunder Breathing's all about
focusing on your legs the most.

68
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,610
See...

69
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,400
when it comes to the size of your own body
or the shape of each of your muscles...

70
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,610
it's actually hard
to get a good grasp of all that.

71
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,870
"It's not true Total Concentration
until you're aware of them all."

72
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,200
That's what...

73
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,620
Gramps, my trainer,
was always telling me.

74
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,340
Each and every fiber of my muscles...

75
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,130
Every single vein in my body...

76
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,920
Circulate air throughout them.

77
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,100
Collect all your strength
into your legs only!

78
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,970
Collect it!

79
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,680
Let it explode with a single breath!

80
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,690
Slash through the air.

81
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,980
Like thunder!

82
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,860
I see you!

83
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,900
I won't let you escape!

84
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,250
Do it! Do it!

85
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,670
This time for sure!

86
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,090
With every ounce of your strength!

87
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,670
Don't you...

88
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,840
Slash its head! No matter what!

89
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,100
...feel the least bit...

90
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,720
sorry for me?

91
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,850
Not at all?

92
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Don't you dare bully the weak!

93
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,670
Your so-called reasons...

94
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,680
are all total crap!

95
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,930
You stupid bastard!

96
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,130
Oh, crap!

97
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,630
I'm getting burned by these flames, too!

98
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,550
Because I've eaten demon flesh!

99
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,090
Tanjiro!

100
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,800
Tanjiro!

101
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,550
Nezuko!

102
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,900
Damn.

103
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,240
My regeneration's slowing down.

104
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,240
Zohakuten's using too much of my power!

105
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,290
I need to replenish myself
with human flesh and blood!

106
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,210
I won't let you escape!

107
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,970
I can sense...

108
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,260
that there are humans...

109
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,390
nearby.

110
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,600
Come back here.

111
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,570
I'm not gonna let you escape!

112
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,540
I'll chase you down
even if you flee to the depths of hell!

113
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,040
And...

114
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,290
I'm gonna cut off your head!

115
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,170
He dares to threaten me?

116
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,470
Where are those humans?

117
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,340
If I consume them...

118
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,310
then I can send that little brat
to his demise in a flash!

119
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,640
Huh?

120
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,390
There they are!

121
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,520
I've found some food!

122
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,570
Of those three brats,
one is a demon and a handful!

123
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,530
Thwarting me at every turn!

124
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,540
As it turns out, that brat's sword can only
lodge itself into my neck, not slash it.

125
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,290
First, let me devour those humans,
and when I've replenished myself...

126
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,420
Oh, crap! That way!

127
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,540
Right!

128
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,500
Come back here!

129
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,170
You're not getting away!

130
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,180
Nezuko...

131
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,400
Get going!

132
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,530
You've got to hurry!

133
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,780
One more time!

134
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,200
One more time...

135
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,450
Use Total Concentration
to push off against the ground!

136
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,500
Tanjiro!

137
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,590
Tanjiro!

138
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,420
Tanjiro!

139
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,770
My sword!

140
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,440
Use it!

141
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,440
To...

142
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,650
Tanjiro, use that sword!

143
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,240
Give that back!

144
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,330
You've got to be kidding me!

145
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,160
I'll kill you! Don't use it!

146
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,540
I've only honed it up to the first stage!

147
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,830
Give it back!

148
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,170
Tanjiro!

149
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,170
It's almost daybreak!
He's going to get away!

150
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,920
You stupid brat!

151
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,960
Ouch!

152
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,470
Tokito...

153
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,180
Thank you!

154
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,230
I'm counting on you...

155
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,190
Tanjiro.

156
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,020
Mr. Tokito?

157
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,650
Huh?

158
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,860
Lord Tokito?

159
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,940
Whoa!

160
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,240
Mr. Haganezuka murdered Mr. Tokito!

161
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,530
What the hell? I didn't do anything!

162
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,610
You inhuman monster!

163
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,530
It's the poison and fever!

164
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,490
Calm down, both of you!

165
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,740
Take it...

166
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,870
Tanjiro.

167
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,590
Everyone's hopes are in that sword.

168
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,720
Total Concentration...

169
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,790

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,060
I did it!

173
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,360
I cut off the head of the main body!

174
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,110
I did it!

175
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
The sun is rising!

176
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,090
She shouldn't be
in this wide-open space!

177
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,340
Nezuko... Run!

178
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,260
Get—.

179
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,720
I can't... get a word out!

180
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,680
No! Nezuko!

181
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,230
You don't have to come this way!

182
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,900
It's you! It's you!

183
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,230
You're the one in danger!
Because the sun's coming up...

184
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,730
if the sunlight hits you,
you're going to die!

185
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,070
Nezuko!

186
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,580
N-Nezuk—.

187
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,160
Run!

188
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,670
Find a place in the shade!

189
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,420
Nezuko!

190
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,850
Run! Run!

191
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,680
It's not dead!

192
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,930
Even though it's been beheaded!

193
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,610
RESENTMENT

194
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,360
The word on its tongue is...

195
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,610
"resentment"?

196
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,360
The main body's tongue
had the word "fear"!

197
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,120
FEAR

198
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,240
This one has a different word!

199
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,540
I messed up!

200
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,750
I have to stop it!

201
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,210
I have to finish it off!

202
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,570
Nezuko!

203
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,280
Make yourself smaller!

204
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,570
Shrink your body!

205
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,450
Shrink it!

206
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,290
The sun's not even all the way up,
and look how bad it is!

207
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,590
Nezuko...

208
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,640
Oh, crap!

209
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,640
Somebody...

210
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,480
Genya...

211
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,270
Tokito...

212
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,900
Who am I kidding?

213
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,370
They can't get here
from the top of that cliff!

214
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,740
Wait! That demon should be burning, too!

215
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,790
No good!

216
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,120
By then, the villagers will be dead!

217
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,130
If I run while carrying Nezuko...

218
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,170
I won't make it in time!

219
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,750
I can't do it!

220
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,420
I can't make up my mind!

221
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,020
I can't make up...

222
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,500
Sniff it out.

223
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,170
It can't have gotten that far!

224
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,890
If the main body had gone off
somewhere far away so fast...

225
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,890
the scent would've told me!

226
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,270
It's nearby!

227
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,860
Where is it?

228
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,480
Pick up its scent!

229
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,190
Its shape!

230
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,820
Its color!

231
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,120
There it is!

232
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,500
It's still inside the demon!

233
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,050
Right!

234
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,670
Clearer...

235
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,050
Give me a clearer view!

236
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,840
Clearer!

237
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,850
Found it!

238
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,680
Inside its heart!

239
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,940
We're done for! We're done for!

240
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,360
It caught up—.

241
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,610
You're finished for sure this time!

242
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,360
You coward!

243
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,570
You evil demon!

244
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,160
Atone for your sins...

245
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,760
with your life!

246
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,560
Why would you steal from others?

247
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,140
And even worse...

248
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,150
from a man who was so kind
to those of us who cannot see...

249
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,400
The Master has chosen
to look the other way,

250
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,610
but I cannot forgive you.

251
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
I am going to the magistrate's office now.

252
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,870
I'm not the one at fault here!

253
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,870
It's these hands that are to blame!

254
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,870
These hands acted on their own!

255
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,710
What the hell is this?

256
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,260
Is that me when I was a human?

257
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,930
Why now after all this time?

258
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,060
I'm told you've committed theft and murder
numerous times in another town, as well.

259
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,060
I have absolutely no sympathy for you!

260
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,110
That's absurd!

261
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,780
I'm not even capable of such a thing!

262
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,440
As someone who's blind...

263
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,450
I know that you can see just fine!

264
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,620
I've had a masseur
come here to Shirasu...

265
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,870
and he would face the wall
until I started speaking.

266
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,420
You say that your hands are to blame?

267
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,920
Then, we'll just slice...

268
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,920
both of them off!

269
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,470
You're going to be beheaded
tomorrow? I pity you.

270
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,970
Let me save you.

271
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,730
No matter how you may try to talk your way
out of it, the facts remain the same!

272
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,520
Silencing me will do you no good!

273
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,280
Is this...

274
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,990
The day will surely come
when you atone for your sins...

275
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,320
with that vile life of yours!

276
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,500
UPPER FOUR

277
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,500
...my life flashing before my eyes?

278
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,310
I won...

279
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,480
but I had to sacrifice Nezuko!

280
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,520
Burned by the sunlight!

281
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,360
Not even Nezuko's bones remain!

282
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,460
Nezuko...

283
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,210
Nezuko!

284
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,640
To turn Nezuko back into a human...

285
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,760
That was why...

286
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,560
That was why I came this far!

287
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,770
Lord Kamado...

288
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,070
L-Lord Kamado?

289
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,900
Lord Kamado!

290
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,700
Lord Kamado...

291
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,950
Mo...

292
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,210
Mo...

293
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,210
Morning!

294
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,600
Nezuko!

295
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,390
Lord Kamado!

296
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,160
Nezuko...

297
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,040
Thank goodness!

298
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Are you all right?

299
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,300
Thank...

300
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,050
Thank goodness.

301
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,460
Are you...

302
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,300
Are you all right?

303
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,100
Thank goodness, right?

304
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,310
Right?

305
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,190
No, really...

306
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,440
thank goodness...

307
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,440
you didn't turn to ash and disappear!

308
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,000
Thank goodness!

309
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,120
I thought that you were dead!

310
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,250
Thank goodness, Nezuko!

311
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,550
I'm so glad you're all right!

312
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,090
Thank goodness!

313
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,220
Yes, thank goodness!

314
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,350
Thanks, both of you, for saving us!

315
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,060
We never could've forgiven ourselves
if Nezuko had perished!

316
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,070
Good for you...

317
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,700
Tanjiro...

318
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,410
Nezuko!

319
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,670
He hit the wall all of a sudden!

320
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,170
Young Kamado, hang in there!

321
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,460
Is he dead? Is he dead?

322
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,170
Idiot!

323
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,210
Are you all right?

324
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,550
Stay with us!

325
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,680
Thank goodness...

326
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,300
Nezuko...

327
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,520
Thank goodness.

328
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,330
I can't take it any more!

329
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,290
I'm so sorry!

330
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,050
I'm about to be killed!

331
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,060
Huh?

332
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,400
Yay! I'm saved!

333
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,580
Tanjiro and the others
must've beheaded the main body!

334
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,380
Toshikuni?

335
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,670
I'm coming in, all right?

336
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,130
Oh my...

337
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,600
What's gotten into you, Toshikuni?

338
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,970
Making such a mess...

339
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,520
I see that you've been doing some research.

340
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,270
You can't find the book that you need?

341
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,110
I'll help you find it.

342
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,150
But first, take a break.

343
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,990
Let's have some tea.

344
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,280
At last...

345
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,240
What's that?

346
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:42,120
At last, someone able
to withstand the sun has appeared!

347
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Good work, Hantengu!

348
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,960
Well, you certainly seem
to be enjoying yourself.

349
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,760
Perhaps it's the stories
you've been reading—.

350
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:51,920
Huh?

351
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,010
Huh? Madam?

352
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,680
What happened...

353
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,520
to your head?

354
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,810
Now...

355
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,570
there's no need to search
for the Blue Spider Lily.

356
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,530
Madam...

357
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,940
That took so long.

358
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,530
But it was for this reason,
for this reason, for one thousand years...

359
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,790
that I've continued
to increase my kind unwillingly!

360
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:36,430
A rare constitution that never showed up
even among the Twelve Kizuki.

361
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,550
The chosen demon.

362
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,310
If I devour that girl and absorb her...

363
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,940
I, too, will be able to conquer the sun!

364
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,940
You murderer! You murderer!
You monster!

365
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,400
Master! Master!

366
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,230
Ma—.

367
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,040
Now that I think of it, it was on that day.

368
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,050
It all started one thousand years ago.

369
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,550
The era was still called Heian back then.

370
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,550
If I may, sir...

371
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:26,060
Your medicine is ready for you now.

372
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,810
You inept doctor...

373
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:35,150
That said, this inept doctor
is the only one I have to lean on.

374
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,200
What will become of me...

375
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,450
if I don't take this?

376
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,120
As you know...

377
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,370
you will not live...

378
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,830
to see your 20th birthday.

379
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,120
I am doing all I can...

380
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,840
to help you live...

381
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,340
even a little longer.

382
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,470
All right, fine.

383
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,130
That's enough.

384
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,100
It won't work anyway.

385
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,900
Ah...

386
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,610
I want to destroy them!

387
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,280
Every living being!

388
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,320
No matter how many times
he examines me...

389
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,780
or administers that medicine...

390
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,290
nothing can stop
my symptoms from worsening.

391
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,340
Death is all you deserve!

392
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,560
You damn incompetent doctor!

393
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,900
But then I realized that this doctor's
medicine was working...

394
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,440
not longer after I'd killed him.

395
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,570
My body was bursting with energy...

396
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,780
and I thought that I'd gained
a durable physique...

397
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,200
but there was one problem.

398
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,290
I couldn't walk in the sunlight.

399
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,260
I could tell.

400
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,680
That if exposed to sunlight, I would die.

401
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,650
I began to crave human flesh and blood.

402
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,650
To remedy that...

403
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,950
all I had to do was devour humans.

404
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,080
If anyone stands in your way,
just eliminate them.

405
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,870
That's all there is to it.

406
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,290
Come back here!

407
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,130
You cursed demon who disrupts
the peace of the capital!

408
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,420
Are you...

409
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,260
talking about me?

410
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,860
I had gained power.

411
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,610
Eternal power!

412
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,160
But...

413
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,660
having to restrict my movements
during the day was humiliating...

414
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,750
and my anger only grew.

415
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:42,510
I began to seek a body
that wouldn't perish in the sunlight.

416
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,890
I examined the compounds
for the doctor's elixir,

417
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,470
but perhaps because it was still
in the experimental stages,

418
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:55,440
I couldn't figure out how to make
the medicine called "Blue Spider Lily."

419
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:01,610
It did seem to contain actual
blue-colored Spider Lilies...

420
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:08,620
but as for where this Blue Spider Lily bloomed
or whether or not it could be cultivated...

421
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,160
no one knew but the doctor I'd killed.

422
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,870
I searched all over Japan
but failed to find it.

423
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,170
In order to become truly immortal...

424
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,130
finding the Blue Spider Lily...

425
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,260
and someone who had the ability
to survive the sunlight...

426
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,640
Those two have been my top priorities.

427
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,640
And at last...

428
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,650
I've found her!

429
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,780
Since that girl has conquered the sun...

430
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:52,030
there's no longer any reason
to increase my kind.

431
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,330
I will absorb her...

432
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,420
and then I will conquer the sunlight.

433
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,380
I will get my hands on Nezuko...

434
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,760
and become a perfect being!

435
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,260
Tanjiro, are you all right?

436
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,100
Hey...

437
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,980
T-Tokito...

438
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,560
Thank goodness...

439
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,940
you're safe!

440
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,940
Thank you for my sword!

441
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,070
I should be thanking you.

442
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,820
Because of you, I recovered
something precious that I'd lost.

443
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,830
Huh? No...

444
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,830
but I didn't do anything.

445
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,120
It's all right.

446
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,460
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

447
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,710
Tokito...

448
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,800
Anyway, what's going on with Nezuko?

449
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,010
Well, actually...

450
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,100
Why, you...

451
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,350
What did you do with my sword?

452
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,730
Calm down!

453
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,940
Huh?

454
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,860
Mr. Haganezuka?

455
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:08,490
I asked you what happened
to the sword I was honing!

456
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,700
I used it to fight an Upper Rank!

457
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,780
Yeah, to fight?

458
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,370
To fight, and...

459
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,450
Huh?

460
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,990
What happened then?

461
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,000
I blacked out, and...

462
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,500
Oh, the sword? I've got it—.

463
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,620
You broke it, right?

464
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,540
Uh, no.

465
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,300
You broke it, didn't
you? Tell me the truth!

466
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,340
Tell! Me! The! Truth!

467
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,300
I didn't... I didn't...

468
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,680
No, it's right here!

469
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,510
I'm going to kill you!

470
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,050
Nezuko, run!

471
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,010
Run!

472
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,220
You're not getting away!

473
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,890
Mr. Haganezuka! Calm down!

474
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,810
Come back here! Come back here!

475
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,350
The sword is right here!

476
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,650
Like hell, I'll calm down!

477
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,560
- Come on, come on!
- You guys!

478
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,480
You guys!

479
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,490
Ms. Kanroji!

480
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,540
We won! We won!

481
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,630
We all won together!

482
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,880
So amazing! We're all alive!

483
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,470
Thank goodness!

484
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,260
Yes, thank goodness!

485
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,810
Huh?

486
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,850
Yes...

487
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,020
thank goodness!

488
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,860
Whaaaaat?

489
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,070
Tanjiro!

490
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,580
Yes?

491
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,250
Thank goodness!

492
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,000
She's talking...

493
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,250
but her eyes and fangs are the same...

494
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,380
so I'm not sure what's going on, but I...

495
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,880
I'm so glad that Nezuko's alive!

496
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,470
Thank goodness she's alive!

497
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,600
Yes! Yes!

498
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,140
Thank goodness!

499
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,640
Thank goodness!

500
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,270
Thank goodness!

501
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,030
Thank goodness!

502
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,450
Thank goodness!

503
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,740
Tanjiro...

504
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,910
I thank you for providing me with the
Twelve Kizuki's and Nezuko's blood...

505
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,290
and for helping me with my research.

506
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,050
The man in Asakusa
who was turned into a demon by Muzan...

507
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,510
has regained his sense of self.

508
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,300
It's thanks to Nezuko's blood.

509
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,810
Released from Muzan's control...

510
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,310
he can live on a small amount of blood.

511
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,690
The transformation of Nezuko's blood
surprises me.

512
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:57,700
In such a short time, the components
of her blood have changed again and again.

513
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,620
All this time...

514
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,500
I have been thinking.

515
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,380
Why it is that Nezuko has yet to regain
her sense of self...

516
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:18,260
and remains in a child-like state?

517
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,260
I believe that...

518
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,180
in Nezuko's mind...

519
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,020
there's something more important
than regaining her sense of self...

520
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,230
something that she needs to prioritize.

521
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,480
Yushiro?

522
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,650
Yushiro?

523
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,860
Yes, Lady Tamayo?

524
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,280
What can I do for you?

525
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,030
Can you summon Chachamaru for me?

526
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,160
Chachamaru is ready to go now.

527
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,630
Give my regards
to Tanjiro and Nezuko, okay?

528
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,310
Tanjiro...

529
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,520
This is pure speculation on my part.

530
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,190
But I believe that it won't be long...

531
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:18,360
before Nezuko can conquer the sun.

532
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:28,870
Right!

533
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,040
Thanks!

534
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,130
Understood!

535
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,770
Lord Tecchin!

536
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,390
Oh! Kotetsu!

537
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,900
Mr. Tanjiro's leaving the village,
so he'd like to say goodbye.

538
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,320
Mr. Tanjiro?

539
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:16,500
HYOTTOKO

540
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,740
Are you feeling all right?

541
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,120
Yes! Thank you
for all that you did for me.

542
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,290
And thank you.

543
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,500
You even provided me
with this cart.

544
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,960
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

545
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,670
You did a good job protecting this village!

546
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,180
I'm grateful to you!

547
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,600
I wasn't able to do that much on my own.

548
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:29,810
It was everyone pulling together!

549
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,850
Our combined strength...

550
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:36,150
and that sword that's been connecting us
to centuries of hopes until today.

551
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,940
That's why we were able to defeat
those Upper Rank demons.

552
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,780
Yes, yes.

553
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,440
You're right.

554
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,110
And where's your sister?

555
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,410
She's asleep.

556
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,580
Since I really exhausted her.

557
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,840
I see!

558
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,420
I'm truly glad that she's all right!

559
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,010
Yes!

560
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,380
Huh?

561
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:14,230
Hey, Kanamori! Is that Hotaru
lurking around over there?

562
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,480
Yes.

563
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,270
What is he doing?

564
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,980
He seems to think that he's hiding...

565
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,150
but apparently, he can't forgive Tanjiro
for using a sword before it was fully honed.

566
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,650
Huh?

567
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,280
What am I going to do with that guy?

568
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,370
Hotaru!

569
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,120
Come over here a second!

570
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,500
I said, come over here!

571
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,050
Hotaru!

572
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,470
I'm telling you, it's all his fault.

573
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,340
Ouch!

574
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,260
Right? Am I right?

575
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,350
Am I right?

576
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,560
Hey! Come on... Hey!

577
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,300
Sorry!

578
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,890
Ouch! That hurts!

579
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,720
Hotaru!

580
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,690
But... if Mr. Tanjiro
and the others hadn't come...

581
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,230
I'm sure the village
would've been destroyed!

582
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,440
Ow! Ow!

583
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,400
Hah!

584
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:05,820
Now, Hotaru...

585
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,610
the real reason you came here
was to speak to Tanjiro...

586
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,160
who came all the way here, right?

587
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,370
Mr. Haganezuka...

588
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:21,210
Thank you for always
taking care of my sword!

589
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,340
I came to this village...

590
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,590
because I wanted to thank you for that.

591
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:33,050
I-I'll reforge your sword for you,
so wait for it at the Butterfly Mansion.

592
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,560
You're going to repair it for me?

593
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,060
Don't you want me to fix it?

594
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,600
Thank you very much!

595
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,060
S-S-Sure.

596
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:43,980
Mr. Haganezuka...

597
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,780
Are you, like, embarrassed?

598
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,320
Kotetsu!

599
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,900
Young Kotetsu!

600
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,910
Pretty funny, huh?

601
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,830
No way am I embarrassed!

602
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,000
Putting his foot in his mouth again!

603
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,380
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

604
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,470
But really, thank you so much!

605
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,300
I'm going to work harder and harder!

606
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,390
Yes! Good luck to you!

607
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,600
All right, Kakushi.

608
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,770
I'm counting on you.

609
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,400
Huh?

610
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,480
Now then, just as you did coming here...

611
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,400
you'll wear this blindfold
and put in these nose plugs.

612
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,620
All right, take care, everyone!

613
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,960
I wish you good health!

614
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,830
Please be careful!

615
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,750
Please come back sometime, okay?

616
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,210
Goodbye!

617
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,980
What's the matter?

618
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,650
Mr. Tanjiro...

619
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,950
Tanjiro!

620
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,120
Thanks!

621
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,370
Thank you!

622
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,490
Take care!

623
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,540
You can count on us
to take care of your swords!

624
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,460
Tanjiro!

625
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,920
Hey, thanks!

626
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,960
Tanjiro!

627
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,460
Thanks!

628
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,460
Thanks!

629
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:01,450
Shall we do without the blindfold and
nose plugs until we've left this village?

630
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,000
Yes!

631
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,870
Thanks!

632
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,960
Tanjiro!

633
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,080
See you!

634
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,920
Thank you!

635
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,250
- Tanjiro!
- Thanks!

636
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,800
- Thank you!
- Tanjiro!
